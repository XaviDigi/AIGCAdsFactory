Create a new video generation task using the Veo3 API.
Our Veo 3 Generation API is more than a direct wrapper around Google’s baseline. It layers extensive optimisation and reliability tooling on top of the official models, giving you greater flexibility and markedly higher success rates — all at less than 20 % of the official Google pricing (see kie.ai/billing for full details).
Capability	Details
Models	• Veo 3 Quality — flagship model, highest fidelity
• Veo 3 Fast — cost‑efficient variant (~20 % of Quality pricing) that still delivers strong visual results
Tasks	• Text → Video
• Image → Video (single reference frame)
Aspect Ratios	Native 16 : 9. We transparently re‑frame to 9 : 16 via a proprietary post‑process, so vertical output is available without extra work on your side.
Languages	Google’s native support is English‑only; our multilingual prompt pre‑processing extends reliable generation to most major languages.
Audio Track	All videos ship with background audio by default. In < 5 % of cases Google suppresses audio when the scene is deemed sensitive (e.g. minors).
Content Governance	Google enforces strict safety filters that often block celebrity or even ordinary‑person photos. We mitigate the majority of these false positives through an optional Intelligent Fallback (see below).
​
Why our Veo 3 API is different
True vertical video – Native Veo 3 ignores 9 : 16; we deliver it via automatic re‑framing, saving you a manual editing pass.
Global language reach – Prompt sanitisation, token‑weight rebalancing and fallback detection jointly lift non‑English success rates far above stock Veo 3 behaviour.
False‑positive rescue – Optional fallback to an alternate Veo 3 backend recovers jobs blocked by over‑zealous moderation (at a higher credit cost).
Significant cost savings – Our rates are under 20 % of Google’s direct API pricing.
​
Intelligent Fallback (enableFallback)
We’ve added a fallback mechanism to the Veo 3 API. If Google’s strict content filters wrongly flag a normal prompt or image—triggering errors like “public error minor upload,” “content policy violations,” or “public error prominent people upload”—you can now reroute the request through an alternative, more lenient Veo 3 channel.
The fallback uses the same Veo 3 model, with audio and the same quality; only the path changes, greatly reducing false positives and boosting success rates.
Property	Type	Default
enableFallback	boolean	false
Setting enableFallback: true instructs the platform to reroute eligible failures to the secondary Veo 3 backend, raising completion rates for edge cases.
​
Trigger conditions
Fallback runs only when the primary request fails with:
public_error_minor_upload
Content‑policy violation
public_error_prominent_people_upload
All other errors return immediately; successful primary runs never invoke fallback.
​
Limitations
16 : 9 only – non‑conforming inputs are auto‑cropped before retry.
Resolution – fallback-generated videos are created in 1080p resolution by default but cannot be accessed via the Get 1080P Video endpoint.
Billing – a successful fallback consumes a separate (higher‑priced) credit tier. See kie.ai/billing for the exact table.
​
Behaviour when disabled
With enableFallback left at false (default), the errors above surface as HTTP 422 responses and no additional credits are consumed.
​
Fallback Functionality
By setting the enableFallback parameter, you can enable intelligent fallback functionality. When the primary model encounters specific errors, the system will automatically switch to a backup model to continue generation, improving task success rates.
Fallback Features:
Enabling Conditions: Set enableFallback: true, aspect ratio 16:9, and encounter specific errors
Applicable Errors: public error minor upload, content policy violations, public error prominent people upload
Image Requirements: Must be 16:9 ratio, otherwise automatic cropping will occur
Credit Calculation: Successful fallback has different credit consumption, please see https://kie.ai/billing for billing details
Important Notes
Fallback functionality only takes effect in specific error scenarios
When fallback is not enabled, encountering fallback-eligible errors will return a 422 status code
Fallback-generated videos are created in 1080p resolution by default but cannot be accessed via the Get 1080P Video endpoint
Authorizations
​
Authorization
stringheaderrequired
All APIs require authentication via Bearer Token.

Get API Key:

Visit API Key Management Page to get your API Key
Usage:
Add to request header:
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

Body
application/json
​
prompt
stringrequired
Text prompt describing the desired video content. Required for all generation modes.

Should be detailed and specific in describing video content
Can include actions, scenes, style and other information
For image-to-video, describe how you want the image to come alive
Example:
"A dog playing in a park"

​
imageUrls
string[]
Image URL list (used in image-to-video mode, only 1 image supported for now).

Must be valid image URLs
Images must be accessible to the API server
Example:
["http://example.com/image1.jpg"]
​
model
enum<string>default:veo3
Select the model type to use.

veo3: Veo 3 Quality, supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation
veo3_fast: Fast generation model, supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation
Available options: veo3, veo3_fast 
Example:
"veo3"

​
watermark
string
Watermark text.

Optional parameter
If provided, a watermark will be added to the generated video
Example:
"MyBrand"

​
aspectRatio
enum<string>default:16:9
Video aspect ratio. Specifies the dimension ratio of the generated video. Available options:

16:9: Landscape video format, supports 1080P HD video generation (Only 16:9 aspect ratio supports 1080P)
9:16: Portrait video format, suitable for mobile short videos
Default value is 16:9.

Available options: 16:9, 9:16 
Example:
"16:9"

​
seeds
integer
(Optional) Random seed parameter to control the randomness of the generated content. Value range: 10000-99999. The same seed will generate similar video content, different seeds will generate different content. If not provided, the system will assign one automatically.

Required range: 10000 <= x <= 99999
Example:
12345

​
callBackUrl
string
Completion callback URL for receiving video generation status updates.

Optional but recommended for production use
System will POST task completion status to this URL when the video generation is completed
Callback will include task results, video URLs, and status information
Your callback endpoint should accept POST requests with JSON payload
For detailed callback format and implementation guide, see Callback Documentation
Alternatively, use the Get Video Details endpoint to poll task status
Example:
"http://your-callback-url.com/complete"

​
enableFallback
booleandefault:false
Enable fallback functionality. When set to true, if the official Veo3 video generation service is unavailable or encounters exceptions, the system will automatically switch to a backup model for video generation to ensure task continuity and reliability. Default value is false.

When fallback is enabled, backup model will be used for the following errors:
public error minor upload
Your prompt was flagged by Website as violating content policies
public error prominent people upload
Fallback mode requires 16:9 aspect ratio and uses 1080p resolution by default
Note: Videos generated through fallback mode cannot be accessed via the Get 1080P Video endpoint
Credit Consumption: Successful fallback has different credit consumption, please see https://kie.ai/billing for billing details
Example:
false
